| **Metadata**         | Bucket policies, settings, and region.     | Custom metadata, ACLs, and object tags.          |

---

### **5) What is S3 data consistency, and how does it work in different scenarios?**

Amazon S3 ensures strong consistency for data operations. This means that any changes to objects are immediately visible to subsequent read requests.

#### **Consistency Models**:
1. **Read-After-Write Consistency**:
   - When you write a new object, subsequent read requests immediately reflect the new data.
   - Applicable for new PUT operations.

2. **Eventual Consistency**:
   - Applies to overwrite (PUT) or delete (DELETE) operations.
   - After updating or deleting an object, it may take some time for all requests to reflect the change, as the updates propagate.

#### **Examples**:
- **New Object Upload**: A newly uploaded file is immediately available for read.
- **Overwrite Object**: Reading the object may return the previous version until the update propagates.
- **Delete Object**: You may still see the object for a short period after deletion.

By ensuring strong consistency, S3 simplifies application development and ensures reliable data access.

### **6) How do you secure data stored in an S3 bucket, and what are the key access control mechanisms in S3?**

#### **Securing Data in S3**:
1. **Encryption**: Protect data at rest and in transit using encryption mechanisms (e.g., SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or client-side encryption).
2. **Access Control**: Use fine-grained access control mechanisms like bucket policies, IAM policies, and Access Control Lists (ACLs).
3. **Block Public Access**: Enable the **"Block Public Access"** setting at the bucket or account level to prevent unauthorized exposure.
4. **Versioning**: Enable bucket versioning to recover from accidental deletions or overwrites.
5. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Enable **Server Access Logging** to track access requests.
   - Use **CloudTrail** to audit access and operations on S3 buckets.

#### **Key Access Control Mechanisms**:
1. **IAM Policies**: Define access permissions for IAM users, groups, or roles at the account level.
2. **Bucket Policies**: JSON-based policies attached to buckets to control access for specific AWS accounts, users, or IP ranges.
3. **ACLs**: Provide legacy-style, object-level permissions for fine-grained control.
4. **Pre-signed URLs**: Grant temporary access to objects for specific use cases.

     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Deny",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "s3:GetObject",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*",
         "Condition": {
           "Bool": {
             "aws:SecureTransport": false
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

#### **IAM Policies**:
- **Scope**: Define permissions at the account level for IAM users, groups, or roles.
- **Use Case**: Assign permissions to access multiple AWS services, including S3.
- **Example**: Granting access to list objects in a specific bucket:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

#### **Key Difference**:
