### **What is Kubernetes, and why is it important in the world of container orchestration?**
Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It ensures applications run efficiently across clusters of servers. Kubernetes is crucial because:
1. **Scalability**: It can scale applications dynamically based on demand.
2. **Resilience**: Automatically restarts failed containers, reschedules them on healthy nodes, and manages rollbacks.
3. **Portability**: Works across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments.
4. **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across containers efficiently.
5. **Declarative Configuration**: Uses YAML/JSON manifests to define desired states.

---

### **Explain the key components of Kubernetes and their roles in container management.**
1. **Master Node Components**:
   - **API Server**: Acts as the entry point for all administrative tasks. It validates and processes REST API requests.
   - **Controller Manager**: Ensures the desired state of the cluster is maintained by managing controllers like Node, Deployment, and Replication controllers.
   - **Scheduler**: Assigns Pods to nodes based on resource requirements and availability.
   - **etcd**: A distributed key-value store that stores cluster configuration and state.

2. **Worker Node Components**:
   - **Kubelet**: An agent on each node that ensures containers are running as defined in Pod specifications.
   - **Kube Proxy**: Manages network communication between Pods and Services.
   - **Container Runtime**: Executes containers (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O).

3. **Additional Components**:
   - **Pods**: The smallest deployable unit containing one or more containers.
   - **Services**: Expose Pods to external networks or within the cluster.
   - **Namespaces**: Logical clusters for resource isolation.

---

### **How do you deploy a containerized application on a Kubernetes cluster? Walk me through the process.**
1. **Create a Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Use tools like Minikube, Kubeadm, or managed services like EKS, AKS, or GKE.

2. **Write a Manifest File**:
   - Create a `Deployment` YAML file to define the application specifications (e.g., image, replicas, ports).

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: my-app
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-app
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: my-app
           image: my-app-image:v1
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

3. **Apply the Manifest**:
   - Use `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`.

4. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Run `kubectl get pods` to check if Pods are running.

5. **Expose the Application**:
   - Create a `Service` to expose the application.
   ```bash
   kubectl expose deployment my-app --type=LoadBalancer --port=80
   ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   - Use the external IP or cluster IP assigned to the service.

---

### **Describe Kubernetes Deployments and StatefulSets. What are the differences, and when would you use one over the other?**
1. **Deployments**:
   - Manage stateless applications.
   - Support rolling updates and rollbacks.
   - Use for applications that donâ€™t require unique identifiers or persistent storage (e.g., web servers).

2. **StatefulSets**:
   - Manage stateful applications.
   - Ensure Pods have stable, unique network IDs and persistent storage.
   - Use for applications like databases, where data persistence and unique Pod identities are required.

**Key Differences**:
- **Storage**: Deployments use ephemeral storage; StatefulSets use persistent storage.
- **Pod Names**: Deployment Pods are dynamically named, while StatefulSet Pods have predictable names (e.g., `web-0`, `web-1`).

---

### **How does Kubernetes handle load balancing for containerized applications?**
1. **Service Load Balancer**:
   - Kubernetes Services distribute traffic across Pods using internal mechanisms like round-robin.
   - `ClusterIP` exposes services within the cluster.
   - `NodePort` and `LoadBalancer` expose services externally.

2. **Ingress**:
   - Provides HTTP/HTTPS routing to services based on URL paths or hostnames.
   - Can be paired with an Ingress Controller for advanced load balancing.

---

### **What is a Kubernetes Namespace, and why would you use multiple namespaces in a cluster?**
Namespaces logically isolate resources within a cluster. Use cases include:
- **Environment Segmentation**: Separate development, staging, and production.
- **Team Isolation**: Different teams can manage their resources independently.
- **Resource Quotas**: Apply limits to prevent one namespace from consuming all resources.

---

### **Explain the concept of Kubernetes Services and how they enable network connectivity for Pods.**
Kubernetes Services provide stable networking for Pods, enabling connectivity and discovery. Types of Services:
1. **ClusterIP**: Default, accessible only within the cluster.
2. **NodePort**: Exposes the service on a static port of each node.
3. **LoadBalancer**: Integrates with cloud load balancers for external access.
4. **ExternalName**: Maps the service to an external DNS name.

---

### **What is the role of a Kubernetes Ingress controller, and how does it work?**
- **Role**: Manages HTTP and HTTPS traffic to services based on rules defined in the Ingress resource.
- **Working**:
  1. Define Ingress rules (e.g., URL path-based routing).
  2. Deploy an Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX, Traefik).
  3. The Ingress Controller watches Ingress resources and configures routing.

---

### **What is Kubernetes' role in auto-scaling, and how can you set up Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)?**
1. **Role**:
   - Kubernetes scales Pods or nodes based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.
   - Enhances resource utilization and application responsiveness.

2. **Setting up HPA**:
   - Ensure the `metrics-server` is deployed.
   - Define an HPA resource:
     ```bash
     kubectl autoscale deployment my-app --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=5
     ```
   - Kubernetes adjusts the number of Pods based on the target metric.
